üì¶ Installation
Install the package from PyPI:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install chgnet_thermal_conductivity
If PyPI installation fails or you wish to use the latest version from the main branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install git+https://github.com/Harpriyaminhas/chgnet_thermal_transport.git
üîß Fine-Tuning CHGNet
To adapt CHGNet for accurate thermal conductivity predictions:

Run Langevin Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations at various temperatures to generate force-displacement datasets.

Train the model using train.py. This will fine-tune CHGNet and save the best model as best_model.pth.

Predict phonon properties using chgnet_phonopy.py, which:

Generates displaced structures

Calculates force constants

Computes phonon band structure and DOS using the fine-tuned model

üìÅ Thermal Conductivity Calculation Scripts
This package includes utilities for computing lattice thermal conductivity:

‚úÖ Phonopy version 2.7.1 required

Replace the default group_velocity.py in Phonopy with the modified version provided to ensure compatibility.

‚úÖ Script included: getkappa.py

Computes the minimum lattice thermal conductivity using phonon properties.

Example input data is provided in the example folder for guidance.
